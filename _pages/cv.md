# Work Experience

## Postdoctoral Research Fellow
University of Michigan<br>
Ann Arbor, MI<br>
*July 2023 -- Present*

**Description**<br>
* Conducts research on system identification of dynamical systems using Bayesian inference/uncertainty quantification resulting in publications/talks.
* Formulates and implements statistical learning algorithms that can outperform popular methods under high uncertainty.
* Communicates with other researchers how to utilize work in pursuit of their research interests.

## R&D Graduate Summer Intern
Sandia National Laboratories<br>
Livermore, CA<br>
*May 2022 -- August 2022*

**Description**<br>
* Independently researched the applicability of functional tensor networks and variational inference for scalable Bayesian estimation of dynamical systems.
* Implemented tensor-train and sampling algorithms and integrated them with pre-existing code.
* Composed a summer-end technical report detailing research findings, conclusions, and future work.
